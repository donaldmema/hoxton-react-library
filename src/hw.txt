Tips
- Try to avoid using too many divs when building your components, 
since it will make your code less reusable. You can always style the
 container in the place where you use the component (or check out the challenge)

- Use the React.Fragment or <> </> if you need to return more than one child

- Don't forget to thoroughly test your components. 
You don't need to go crazy - console.log'ing the values or setting a piece
 of state (and testing it) should give you an idea.

- You are welcome to look at other component libraries for inspiration



Instructions
- Start a new project
- Create components, similar to the Button component Nico built during the lecture. 
  1) Button: should return a button styled however you like. Make it use a few 
    useful custom props similar to how Nico used them during the lecture - like 
    size or variant. âœ…
  2) Input: returns a label and an input under it, both customizable.
  3) CheckboxGroup: a group of checkboxes. The component should take:
    - an array of items and render a list of checkboxes based on them. 
        (Think what should go into the array!)
    - an onSelect: selecting a checkbox should run the function. 
        Make sure you can check which checkbox you selected.
  4) RadioGroup: A group of radio buttons. Same idea as the checkbox group:
     - takes a list of items and renders radio buttons for each of them
     - onSelect which runs the function we pass to the component.

- Test your components by using them in App and giving them some test data.
